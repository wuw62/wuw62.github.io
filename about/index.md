Hello, I’m Weiyi. 

I'm a 25-year-old recent graduate with a master's degree in computing and software. I enjoy designing and working things on web. When I’m not writing codes, I'm either in the kitchen cooking udon noodles or can be found outside walking trails. I love travelling and taking pictures. I decided to make this site as my personal blog, share my thoughts and some great ideas here.
