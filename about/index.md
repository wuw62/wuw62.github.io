Hello, I’m Weiyi. 

I'm a web developer based in Toronto. I enjoy designing and working things on web. When I’m not writing codes, I can be found either walking trails or could be in any other outdoors. I love travelling and taking pictures. I plan to make this site as my personal blog, share my thoughts and some great ideas here...
