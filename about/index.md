Hello, I’m Weiyi. 

I'm a web developer based in Toronto. Originally from China, educated in US and Canada. I enjoy designing and working things on web. When I'm off screen, you can find me either walking trails, ski or in the kitchen inventing some new taste great. I also love movies travel and photography. This site is my personal blog, I'll share my thoughts and some ideas here in the future.
